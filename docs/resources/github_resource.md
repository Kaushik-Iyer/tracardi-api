# Resource configuration and set-up

To add a GitHub resource, you need to add your PAT (personal access token).

1. __api_url__ - usually this does not need changing and can be left at the default value of https://api.github.com.
2. __personal_access_token__ - this is a personal access token linked to your GitHub account. Refer to the link below
   for how to generate a PAT.

For more details you can refer to the following help articles:

* [Github documentation on personal tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)

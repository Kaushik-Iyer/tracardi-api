The documentation text provides answers to questions about the capabilities of Tracardi, a customer data platform. It explains that Tracardi can segment data based on leads' attributes such as lead added date, lead source, lead ID, opens, clicks, sold/not sold, click/open dates, etc. It also states that Tracardi has been tested to store 10 million events per profile, and is designed to handle large volumes of data efficiently. Additionally, it can import customer interactions from external email marketing software like Mailwizz, either streamed live or scheduled. Tracardi assigns unique IDs to leads and keeps a history of previous IDs, allowing it to track customers across different devices and merge their profiles. Finally, Tracardi uses Elasticsearch and Kibana for simple analytics, but for in-depth analysis, it is recommended to use an external system. Tracardi can send event data to external systems if necessary, allowing integration with data warehouse tools or other analytical platforms.

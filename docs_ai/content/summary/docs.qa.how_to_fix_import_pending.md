In this documentation, we have provided a guide to start an import worker and resolve import pending errors in Tracardi.
We have outlined the steps to start the worker, verify that it is running, check the background tasks, and troubleshoot
any errors that may occur during the import process. If you encounter any issues, refer to the Tracardi documentation
or seek help from the Tracardi community.

It is on your computer, so you can run it like this.\n\n```\ndocker run -p 8686:80 -e ELASTIC_HOST=http://<your-laptop-ip>:9200 tracardi-api\n```\n\n!!! Note \"Replace <your-laptop-ip> with your laptop IP\"\n\n    Notice that that you can not type `http://localhost:9200`. This means that you're\n    connecting to the docker itself as localhost means local in docker. Obviously elastic \n    is not there, so Tracardi will never connect. Pass external ip for elastic. \n    This may be your laptop IP if you are running Tracardi locally.\n\n!!! Tip \n    \n    On windows you can use `ipconfig` command to find out your laptop IP.\n    \n---\nThis documentation answers the following questions:\n    \n* How can I build a Tracardi docker image?\n"}

Tip\n\n    If you want elasticsearch to run in the background, type: \n    `docker run -d -p 9200: 9200 -p 9300: 9300 -e \"discovery.type = single-node\" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.13.2`\n\n## Download the source code\n\nOpen a terminal and go to the directory where you want to keep the code. Enter:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Tracardi/tracardi  #(1)\ngit clone https://github.com/Tracardi/tracardi-api #(2)\n```\n\n1. Clones tracardi repository. Code will be available in tracardi folder.\n2. Clones tracardi-api repository\n\n## Create virtual environments\n\nWe need to create 2 virtual environments. Type:\n\n```bash\ncd tracardi-api\npython3.9 -m venv venv  # (1)\ncd ..\ncd tracardi\npython3.9 -m venv venv # (2)\n```\n\n1. Installs virtual environment with python 3.9 for tracardi API\n2. Installs virtual environment with python 3.9 for tracardi library\n\n!!! Tip\n\n    Before creating the virtual environment make sure you have version 3.9.x installed. Type `python --version` to see the python version.\n\n## Install dependencies\n\n=== \"Linux\"\n\n    ```bash\n    # Activates virtual environment (1)\n    cd tracardi-api\n    source venv/bin/activate\n    \n    # Installs dependencies\n    pip install -r app/requirements.txt\n    deactivate \n\n    cd ..\n    \n    cd tracardi\n    source venv/bin/activate\n    \n    # Installs dependencies (2)\n    pip install -r tracardi/requirements.txt\n    deactivate\n    ```\n\n    1. Only tracardi-api is required to run the API. Tracardi library will be installed as dependency.\n    2. Installs dependencies of Tracardi API.\n\n=== \"Windows\"\n\n    ```bash\n    cd tracardi-api\n    venv\\\\Scripts\\\\activate\n    \n    // Installs dependencies\n    pip install -r app\\\\requirements.txt\n    deactivate\n\n    cd ..\n\n    cd tracardi\n    venv\\\\Scripts\\\\activate\n    \n    // Installs dependencies\n    pip install -r tracardi\\\\requirements.txt\n    deactivate\n\n    ```\n\n=== \"Mac OS\"\n\n    ```bash\n    # Activates virtual environment (1)\n    cd tracardi-api\n    source venv/bin/activate\n    \n    # Installs dependencies\n    pip install -r app/requirements.txt\n    deactivate \n\n    cd ..\n    \n    cd tracardi\n    source venv/bin/activate\n    \n    # Installs dependencies (2)\n    pip install -r tracardi/requirements.txt\n    deactivate\n    ```\n\n    1. Only tracardi-api is required to run the API. Tracardi library will be installed as dependency.\n    2. Installs dependencies of Tracardi API.\n\n!!! Tip\n\n    Before creating the virtual environment make sure you have version 3.9.x installed. Type `python --version` to \n    see the python version.\n\n!!! Bug \"Trouble shooting\"\n\n    If you see an error that some of the libraries can not be installed, this may mean that you do not have python \n    version 3.9.x installed in your virtual environment.\n\n## Importing project into PyCharm\n\nThe API and tracardi library are installed. Now it is time to open IDE and run it inside code editor. Tracardi API\ndepends on tracardi library we will need to reference library inside Tracardi API project.\n\n1. Open `PyCharm`\n2. Click `File/Open`\n3. Find and select `tracardi-api` folder\n4. Click open project in `new window`\n5. In the right lower corner next to maser b"}

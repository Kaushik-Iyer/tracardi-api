What is the purpose of the installation token given to tenants during setup in Tracardi's multi-tenant environment?", "5. How can multiple multi-tenant instances be created in Tracardi's environment?"], "answer": "# How Tenants are differentiated in Tracardi multi-tenant environment?\nIn Tracardi's multi-tenant environment, tenants are distinguished based on their unique domains and associated API URLs.\nEach tenant receives a specific GUI and API URL, along with an installation key. It's important to understand that\nalthough the domains may differ, they all point to the same Tracardi instance.\n\nThe tenant name is derived from the API domain by removing non-alphanumeric characters. For instance, if the API domain\nis \"company-x.tracardi.com,\" the corresponding tenant name would be \"companyx.\" This tenant name serves as a unique\nidentifier and helps create separate storage namespaces, ensuring data isolation between tenants.\n\nTo set up a new tenant, they access Tracardi using their dedicated GUI URL. During the initial access, they are guided\nthrough the installation process and asked to define an admin account. To ensure security, an installation token is\nprovided, which must be copied into the installation form to authorize the setup.\n\n\n!!! Tip\n\n    **Important:** The installation token is a unique and hard-to-guess string provided to the tenant during the setup\n    process. It acts as a verification mechanism, ensuring that only authorized individuals can install the Tracardi system\n    for the respective tenant.\n\nOnce the system is installed, the tenant gains access to their admin account and can use their GUI URL to access\nTracardi. This approach allows multiple tenants to coexist within the same Tracardi instance while maintaining data\nseparation and tenant-specific configurations.\n\nIf multiple multi-tenant instances are needed, different domains can be used, such as \"tenant-name.instance1.domain.com\"\nand \"tenant-name.instance2.domain.com,\" connected to separate Elasticsearch instances. The number of tenants per\ninstance depends on Elasticsearch capacity.\n\nIt's essential to ensure that subdomains are directed to different IP addresses where Tracardi is installed, ensuring\ninstance separation.\n\nThis organization of domains and instances in Tracardi enables efficient management of multi-tenant environments,\naccommodating scalability and flexibility based on the needs of each instance.\n", "hash": "36d57fd53ef8b2a87d6945ef68cb2303432d0628"}

These event types are\ndesigned to track the customer journey on websites or applications. When these internal event types are used, Tracardi\nautomatically detects them and populates the profile and session with relevant data.\n\nUsing predefined event types streamlines the use of Tracardi and simplifies the process of data collection and analysis.\nThe default properties of these event types eliminate the need for manual copying. They include information such as the\nevent type, event properties (characteristics or attributes of the event), and contextual data that provides additional\ndetails about the event.\n\nSome examples of predefined event types in Tracardi include:\n\n* Page View: Triggered when a customer visits a new page on the website or application. It captures the URL of the page and the time of the visit.\n* Search: Triggered when a customer performs a search on the website or application. It captures the search query and the category of the search.\n* Signup: Triggered when a customer signs up for an account. It captures the customer's first name, last name, email address, and login information.\n* Identification: Triggered when a customer logs into their account. It captures the customer's login information.\n* Purchase Order: Triggered when a customer makes a purchase. It captures the details of the purchase, such as the product ID, name, price, and quantity.\n* Cart Update: Triggered when a customer adds or removes items from their shopping cart. It captures the details of the update, including the product ID, name, price, and quantity.\n\nUsing these predefined event types helps in understanding customer behavior and preferences, allowing for better website\nor application optimization for improved engagement and conversions.\n"}

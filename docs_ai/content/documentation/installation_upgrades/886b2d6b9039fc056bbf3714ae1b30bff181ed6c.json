{"file_name": "docs/installation/upgrades.md", "questions": ["What is the process for upgrading Tracardi to version 0.7.0?"], "answer": "# Installation of version 0.7.0\nAs it was said above the versions prior to 0.7.0 are not aware of previous data schemas. Therefore, the system does not\nknow what indexes were used previously and it is not able to check the changes that have occurred in their schemas. That\nmeans, the manual data migration by re-indexing is necessary. If the collected data in previous versions is not\nimportant and it is possible to lose it, we recommend a fresh install.\n\n## Manual transfer\n\nTo transfer data, first check what indexes you have in elasticsearch. This can be done by going to __Monitoring /\nElasticsearch indices__ in Tracardi. Indexes marked __Connected__ are currently in use and are prefixed with a version\nnumber. Old indexes from system e.g. version 0.6.0, do not have a prefix and are marked as __Not Connected__.\n\nTo transfer data, use the reindex function available in elasticsearch. Documentation of this functionality can be found\nhere.\n\n```\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-reindex.html\n```\n\nReindexing data is nothing more than copying it from one index to another.\n\n---\nThis documentation answers the following questions:\n\n* How can I upgrade Tracardi?\n* What is data migration?\n* How to migrate Tracardi to new version?\n* What's the minimum version required for automated system updates in Tracardi?\n* What was the limitation with system data updates in versions before 0.7.0?\n* How does Tracardi handle indexes when upgrading to a new version?\n* Why is it important to install dockers with a tagged version during system updates?\n* Do you need to manually migrate data when upgrading from a version before 0.7.0 to version 0.7.0?\n* How can you check your indexes in Elasticsearch when transferring data?\n"}

This means that any change or error\nin a workflow could potentially break the running system. To mitigate this risk, Tracardi uses a staging mechanism where\nworkflows are maintained in two different stages: development and production. The development workflow is editable and\nserves as a sandbox for making changes, while the production workflow is the stable and running version. Users can\ndeploy the development workflow to production once they are confident that the changes are ready to be implemented.", "hash": "16c8fe1eae0b451251f138236943cc6edfc9c9fe"}

It contains information\nabout characteristics, interests, and activities. The profile is updated based on incoming events and data from external\nsystems, and it includes both public and private data.\n\nTracardi collects data from customer journeys. These interactions are captured as events. Each event is assigned to a\nprofile that is maintained throughout the customer interaction. Tracardi aggregates customer journey data in the profile\nusing a graphical editor, where the administrator defines the method of attaching data to the profile.\n"}

It takes\ncare of importing data and ensuring that the system data is migrated and upgraded to newer versions. Without this\nworker, you won't be able to import or upgrade the system. If the worker is not functioning properly, you will notice\nthat all the background processes are in a pending state.\n", "hash": "ea5ae0a9a408103197f286967d5f0de93c2baa69"}

It has defined strategies such\n  as:\n    - inactive-profile: Gets profiles if no event happened in `wait_period` time and there was no event\n      type `event_type` E.g. This allows to raise for example an event `inactive` if no activity on profile in 2 days\n      and no `inactive` event available in all profile events.\n    - inactive-session:  Gets session if no event happened in `wait_period` time and there was no event\n      type `event_type`. E.g. This allows to raise for example an event `inactive` if no activity in 15 min and\n      no `inactive` event available within the session\n    - session-not-closed: Gets all profiles if there is no event for a defined period (15 min) and raise session closed\n      event.\n\n### Live Segmentation\n\n- Source: com-tracardi/com_job/segmentation\n- Github: https://github.com/Tracardi/com-tracardi\n- Docker: tracardi/com-tracardi-segmentation-job\n- Description: Iterate over live segmentation flows and push to the segmentation:live queue a job for worker that\n  segments the profile based on the live workflows.\n\n## Commercial Workers\n\n### Scheduler\n\n- Source: None\n- Github: https://github.com/Tracardi/com-tracardi\n- Docker: tracardi/com-tracardi-scheduler-worker, tracardi/com-tracardi-scheduler\n- Description: background processes for Pause and Result actions. This is basically as rq worker and rqscheduler from RQ\n  library.\n\n### Segmentation and Coping\n\n- Source: com-tracardi/com_worker\n- Github: https://github.com/Tracardi/com-tracardi\n- Docker: tracardi/com-tracardi-segmentation-worker\n- Redis Queue Worker that monitors the following queues:\n    - segmentation:live,\n    - event_to_profile_coping:worker,\n    - event_props_to_event_traits:worker\n- Description:\n    - event_props_to_event_traits:worker is responsible for background coping of historical event properties to traits.\n    - event_to_profile_coping:worker is responsible for background event to profile coping\n    - segmentation:live is responsible for warning live segmentations. It is triggered by segmentation job.\n\n## Commercial bridges\n\n- Source: com-bridge-queue\n- Github: https://github.com/Tracardi/com-bridge-queue\n- Description: Queue bridges.\n\n## Open-source Tracardi API\n\n- Source:tracardi\n- Github: https://github.com/Tracardi/tracardi-api\n- Description: This is open-source Tracardi API responsible for collecting and processing events.\n\n## Open-source Workers\n\n- Source:tracardi/worker\n- Github: https://github.com/Tracardi/tracardi-api\n- Description: This is open-source Tracardi worker responsible for imports and system migration. \n\n---\nThis document also answers the questions.\n\n- Provide an overview of the different components that comprise Tracardi ?\n- What are the key building blocks or modules that constitute Tracardi ?\n- What are the fundamental components or sections within Tracardi ?\n- What are the main functions of Tracardi components ?\n", "hash": "c4b7466b5b0f1bed912c080028ebd2062d24283e"}

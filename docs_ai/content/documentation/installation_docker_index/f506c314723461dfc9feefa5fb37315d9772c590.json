{"file_name": "docs/installation/docker/index.md", "questions": ["Question 1: What are the dependencies needed to run Tracardi as a docker container?", "Optional Question 1: How do you start the ElasticSearch database?", "Optional Question 2: How do you start the Tracardi API?", "Optional Question 3: How do you start the Tracardi GUI?"], "answer": "# Docker container installation\nThe easiest way to run Tracardi is to run it as a docker container.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nTracardi needs the following elements to run:\n\n* Elasticsearch\n* Redis\n* Tracardi API\n* Tracardi GUI\n\nYou will need to start the docker containers for all the above services. \n\n## Start ElasticSearch database\n\nTracardi need elasticsearch as its backend. Please pull and run elasticsearch single node docker before you start\nTracardi.\n\nYou can do it with this command.\n\n```\ndocker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e \"discovery.type=single-node\" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.13.2\n```\n\n!!! Note\n\n    Running one instance of elasticsaerch is not a production solution. For production purposes, \n    it is necessary to run the elasticearch cluster. You can also [read here how to connect Tracardi](../../configuration/elasticsearch/connecting_elasticsearch_cluster.md) \n    to an elasticsearch cluster\n\n#### Redis\n\nYou will need a redis instance as well.\n\nStart it with:\n\n```\ndocker run -p 6379:6379 redis\n```\n\n## Start Tracardi API\n\n!!! Note\n\n    The following instalation description use the latest tracardi container version. If you would like to install stable version \n    of the system, what we strongly recommend, please add to `tracard/tracardi-api` a tag with version, e.g `tracardi/tracardi-api:0.7.1`. \n    The same applies to `tracardi/tracardi-gui`. Keep the version of API and GUI the same. \n\n### Run Tracardi API\n\nNow pull and run Tracardi backend.\n\n```bash\ndocker run -p 8686:80 -e ELASTIC_HOST=http://<your-laptop-ip>:9200 -e REDIS_HOST=redis://<your-laptop-ip>:6379 tracardi/tracardi-api #(1)\n```\n\n1. Replace <your-laptop-ip> with your local laptop IP. You can remove `-e REDIS_HOST=redis://<your-laptop-ip>:6379` if\n   you did not start redis. Without redis some system features are unavailable.\n\nTracardi must connect to elasticsearch. To do that you have to set ELASTIC_HOST variable to reference your laptop's or\nserver IP.\n\n!!! Warning \"Waiting for application startup\"\n\n    Notice that when type `http://localhost:9200` you try to connect to Elastic on localhost. This means that you're\n    connecting to the docker itself as localhost means local in docker. Obviously elastic is not there, so Tracardi will\n    never connect. Pass external ip for elastic. This may be your laptop IP if you are running Tracardi locally.\n\nFor more troubleshooting solutions go to [Troubleshooting](../../trouble/index.md)\n\n\n### Connecting Tracardi to ElasticSearch via SSL\n\nIf you have an elasticsearch instance and you would like to connect to it via HTTPS this is the command you may find\nuseful.\n\n```bash\ndocker run -p 8686:80 -e ELASTIC_HOST=https://user:password@<your-laptop-ip>:9200 -e ELASTIC_VERIFY_CERTS=no -e REDIS_HOST=redis://<your-laptop-ip>:6379 tracardi/tracardi-api #(1)\n```\n\n1. If you want a certain version of docker image add version tag, e.g. `tracardi/tracardi-api:0.7.1`\n\n!!! Warning \"ELASTIC_VERIFY_CERTS set to No\"\n\n    Notice that the above command does not verify SSL certificates. If you would like certificates to be validated set \n    ELASTIC_VERIFY_CERTS to yes.\n\n## Start Tracardi GUI\n\nPull and run Tracardi Graphical User Interface.\n\n```bash\ndocker run -p 8787:80 tracardi/tracardi-gui #(1)\n```\n\n1. If you want a certain version of docker image add version tag, e.g. `tracardi/tracardi-gui:0.7.1`\n\n!!! Note\n\n    Notice that the `API_URL` is set to `localhost`. If the API is located somewhere else __replace localhost with the\n    ip pointing to API__.\n\n## Import worker\n\nTo run an import worker you will need the tracardi/update-worker to do the background importing of the data. Run the following \ncommand to start the worker. \n\n```bash\ndocker run -e REDIS_HOST=redis://<redis-ip>:6379 -d tracardi/update-worker:0.8.0 #(1)\n```\n\n1. If you want a certain version of docker image add version tag, e.g. `tracardi/worker:0.8.0`\n\n\n!!! Note\n\n    Replace the `<redis-ip>` with the IP of the redis instance. Keep the version of worker th", "hash": "f506c314723461dfc9feefa5fb37315d9772c590"}

To troubleshoot\nthis problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Double-check the API URL**: Ensure that the API URL you are using is accurate and correctly points to the Tracardi\n   API. A mistyped or incorrect URL could lead to a 404 response or similar errors.\n\n2. **Test the API URL in the browser**: To confirm if the URL is correct, enter the API URL directly into your web\n   browser and see if you receive a response. A valid response should look like this:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"details\": \"Not found\"\n   }\n   ```\n   The \"Not found\" message is expected since you are providing the API URL only, not the full endpoint URL.\n\n3. **Check API logs**: Examine the logs of the API server to identify any errors related to the connection between the\n   API and the Elasticsearch server. If there are issues with the connection, it could result in the \"Network Error\"\n   mentioned in the original message.\n\n4. **Verify Elasticsearch connectivity**: Ensure that the Elasticsearch server is operational and accessible. The API\n   should be able to establish a connection to the Elasticsearch server for proper functionality. If there are any\n   problems with Elasticsearch, it may prevent the API from functioning correctly.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively troubleshoot and identify the cause of the \"Network Error\" when selecting\nthe API URL.\n\n---\nThis document also answers the questions:\n\n* I see error: Status: undefined, Message: undefined, Details Error: Network Error, when selecting the API URL\n", "hash": "1520542dd8d4a3812c924c1aa663eaaa334b67a8"}

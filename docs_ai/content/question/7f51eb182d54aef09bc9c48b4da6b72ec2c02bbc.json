{"file_name": "docs/plugins/tutorial/part1.md", "questions": ["What is the process for registering a plug-in on the list of available plug-ins for installation?"], "answer": "## Automatic plug-in loading.\nThe only thing left is to register the plug-in on the list of available plug-ins for installation. We do this by\npointing to the file with the register function.\n\nTo do that, go to the directory: `/tracardi/service/setup` and find the file `setup_plugins.py` This is the list of all\navailable plugins in the system.\n\nAt the top of this file you will find the variable `installed_plugins: Dict [str, PluginTestTemplate]` which is a\ndictionary where the key is the location of the register function. The value is an object of the `PluginTestTemplate`\ntype, it is responsible for the test data for the plug-in. We will not write tests, so our block of code should look\nlike this:\n\n=== \"/tracardi/service/setup/setup_plugins.py\"\n\n    ```python\n    \"tracardi.process_engine.action.v1.my_plugin_folder.my_plugin\": PluginMetadata(  # (1)\n        test=PluginTest(init=None, resource=None)\n    ),\n    ```\n\n    1. Key is the package of the register function\n\nType this into the `installed_plugins` dictionary, and we are ready to install the plugin.\n\nRestart the Tracardi API so the changes are activated and go to `Processing/Workflows`, open any workflow and click the\n`Reinstall Plugins` button. Alternatively you can go to `Maintenance/Plug-ins` and click the `Reinstall Plugins` button."}

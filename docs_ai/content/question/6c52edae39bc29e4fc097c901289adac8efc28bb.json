This can be done by going to __Monitoring /\nElasticsearch indices__ in Tracardi. Indexes marked __Connected__ are currently in use and are prefixed with a version\nnumber. Old indexes from system e.g. version 0.6.0, do not have a prefix and are marked as __Not Connected__.\n\nTo transfer data, use the reindex function available in elasticsearch. Documentation of this functionality can be found\nhere.\n\n```\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-reindex.html\n```\n\nReindexing data is nothing more than copying it from one index to another."}

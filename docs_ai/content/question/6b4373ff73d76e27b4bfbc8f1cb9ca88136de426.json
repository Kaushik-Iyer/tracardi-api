This is done for security reasons, as the staging server should not be exposed to\nthe internet and should only be accessible within the internal network, preferably through a VPN. This ensures that only\nthe production collector endpoints are publicly available.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to limit access to the production server by not having accounts with roles that allow\nchanges to the server configuration. The best practice is to have a single admin account and only marketing accounts\nthat can view data but not change any settings. This helps to prevent unauthorized access or changes that could\npotentially disrupt the production environment."}

It is build in a way that anyone with basic knowledge of python can add new action\nnodes. That's why you can find a lot of plug-ins for Tracardi on the Internet. New actions can be installed on the system simply\nby adding its module name. Tracardi will then download the plugin code and install it. See more about plugins installation \nin plugins section.\n\n### Action configuration\n\nMost of the actions need configuration. It is done by filling the configuration file in JSON format. Most of\nnone-technical user are not familiar with JSON so the action nodes come with plain forms that fill the JSON\nconfiguration automatically after the user saves the data in the form. There is no need for the user to manually edit\nJSON files.\n\nThere are cases when IT personnel wants to inspect the configuration so the JSON file is also visible in the action\nconfiguration in the Graphical User Interface. Information edited in JSON is automatically visible in forms, as well.\n\n### Action documentation\n\nThis manual provides a detailed workflow actions documentation. It documents how to use and configure the plugin. The\ninformation provided shows how to configure the plugin using the JSON configuration file. Configuration via forms should\nbe self-explanatory so there is no additional documentation for this."}

A rule consists of a condition and the name of a workflow. When an event is received, the system checks the condition of the rule to see if it is met. If the condition is met, the associated workflow is executed.\n\nThe condition of a rule has two elements: the event type and the source. If the event is of a certain type and comes from a specific source, the rule's condition is considered to be met, and the associated workflow is executed.\n\nThe rules in the Tracardi system provide a link between events and the workflows that should be executed in response to those events. By defining appropriate rules, it is possible to automate the execution of workflows based on the arrival of specific events in the system."}

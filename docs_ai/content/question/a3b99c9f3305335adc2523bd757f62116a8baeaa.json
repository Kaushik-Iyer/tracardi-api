Therefore, the system does not\nknow what indexes were used previously and it is not able to check the changes that have occurred in their schemas. That\nmeans, the manual data migration by re-indexing is necessary. If the collected data in previous versions is not\nimportant and it is possible to lose it, we recommend a fresh install.\n\n## Manual transfer\n\nTo transfer data, first check what indexes you have in elasticsearch. This can be done by going to __Monitoring /\nElasticsearch indices__ in Tracardi. Indexes marked __Connected__ are currently in use and are prefixed with a version\nnumber. Old indexes from system e.g. version 0.6.0, do not have a prefix and are marked as __Not Connected__.\n\nTo transfer data, use the reindex function available in elasticsearch. Documentation of this functionality can be found\nhere.\n\n```\nhttps://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-reindex.html\n```\n\nReindexing data is nothing more than copying it from one index to another."}

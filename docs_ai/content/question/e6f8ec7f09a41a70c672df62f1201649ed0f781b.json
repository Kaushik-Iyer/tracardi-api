{"file_name": "docs/trouble/index.md", "questions": ["What is the cause of the error message \"Cannot connect to host elasticsearch:9200 ssl:default [Connection refused]\"?", "Optional: How does Tracardi check if Elastic is ready?", "Optional: What does the log message \"INFO:uvicorn.error:Waiting for application startup.\" mean?"], "answer": "## Connecting to Elasticsearch\n```\naiohttp.client_exceptions.ClientConnectorError: Cannot connect to host elasticsearch:9200 ssl:default [Connection refused]\n```\n\nThis information may come up if elasticsearch is not running. When elasticsearch starts Tracardi will resume\nautomatically. This information is usually displayed when Tracardi starts before elastic is ready. Tracardi waits for\nelastic to start and checks if it's ready every 5 seconds.\n\nThe above error log may look like this:\n\n```\nINFO:     Started server process [10864]\nINFO:uvicorn.error:Started server process [10864]\nINFO:     Waiting for application startup.\nINFO:uvicorn.error:Waiting for application startup.\n```\n\nThis means Tracardi is waiting for Elastic to start. You will see TimeOut messages if Tracardi could not connect to\nElastic long enough.\n\n### Elastic at localhost error\n\nWhen you run Tracardi API like this:\n\n```\ndocker run -p 8686:80 -e ELASTIC_HOST=http://localhost:9200 tracardi/tracardi-api\n```\n\nNotice that you try to connect to Elastic on localhost. When you run it like this means that you're connecting to the\ndocker itself as localhost means local in docker. Obviously elastic is not there, so Tracardi will never connect. Pass\nexternal ip for elastic. This may be your laptop IP if you are running Tracardi locally."}

It is the process of linking multiple pieces of data about a single individual or entity, in order to create a complete and accurate picture of that individual or entity. This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as matching data based on common attributes, using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in the data, or using external data sources to supplement and verify the data.\n\nIn the context of a customer data platform (CDP), identity resolution is used to link together data about a customer from multiple sources, such as website interactions, email campaigns, and customer service interactions, by merging the data."}

This allows businesses to handle different types of events in different ways, and to route events to the most appropriate workflow based on their characteristics.\n\nFor example, an e-commerce platform might route events related to product purchases to a workflow that handles order processing and fulfillment, while routing events related to customer login attempts to a workflow that handles authentication and security. By routing events to the appropriate workflow, businesses can more effectively manage and process the data associated with the event."}

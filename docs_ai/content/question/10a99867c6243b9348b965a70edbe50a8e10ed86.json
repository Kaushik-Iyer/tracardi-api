To avoid single point of failure create multiple instances of\nload balancer.  \nTracardi do not require long-lasting sticky sessions, so you can configure your DNS servers to return multiple A\nrecords (IP addresses) for your domain.\n\nThis kind of architecture will allow you to scale Tracardi for small and high traffic.\n\nIf Tracardi is configured to run in HTTPS mode, the load balancer should accept encrypted traffic. Requests inside the\ncluster may stay not encoded. This way, you can bypass the certificate management problems for each Tracardi instance."}

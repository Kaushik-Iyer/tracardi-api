One for GUI and one for event collection.\n\nThe event collecting cluster, the one available on the Internet, should be configured with environment\nvariable `EXPOSE_GUI_API` set to `no`. This way the publicly available API will have only `/track` endpoint available.\nAll other endpoints that are required by the GUI will be disabled. This cluster will be used for event collection from\nthe website or other sources available on the Internet.\n\nAnother cluster, the one available in the internal network, or available on the Internet but restricted to certain set\nof IPs, should have the environment variable `EXPOSE_GUI_API` set to `yes`. This cluster will be used by GUI to control\nTracardi."}

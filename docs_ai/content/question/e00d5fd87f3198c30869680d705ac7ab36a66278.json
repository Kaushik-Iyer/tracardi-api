For example, after sending an email, use the \"Copy Data\" action in Tracardi to set a\nflag in the profile (e.g., profile@aux.sent_email = 1). Before triggering the email, you can check this flag to determine\nif the email has already been sent for a specific event.\n\nRemember, it's important to save and utilize the necessary information in the profile to conditionally send emails and\navoid duplicate sends based on specific events or user actions.\n\nIf you need further assistance, don't hesitate to seek help from Tracardi support or consult with the Tracardi\ncommunity.\n"}

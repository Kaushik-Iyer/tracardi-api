A\nrule is a simple filtering process that checks that an event comes from a defined source and has a defined event type.\nFor example, a simple rule might require a website to be the source of an event and a page-view for the event. Then, if\nan event occurs meets these criteria, the rule will run the defined flow and send the event data.\n\nThe rules connect events of a given type with the indicated workflow.\n\n!!! Warning\n\n    Events that at the time of their registration did not have rules created, i.e. they were not connected to the process\n    that processes them, are not processed. They remain in the `received state`. Tracardi does not currently offer\n    reprocessing of old data. More on events can be found in [Event's core definitions](../events/index.md)\n\n!!! Tip\n\n    You can find more about the technical aspects of collecting events and processing them in \n    [Event tracking](../events/event_tracking.md)"}

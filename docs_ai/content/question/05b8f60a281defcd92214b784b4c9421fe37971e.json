When a user clicks on one of the links that you have\ndefined in Inbound Traffic/Event Redirects, they will be redirected to the specified URL. At the same time, an event\nwill be sent to Tracardi, providing information about the redirect and any event properties that you have defined.\n\nThe process of setting up Inbound Traffic/Event Redirects involves the following steps:\n\n* Define the links that you want to redirect: This could be any link on your website or in an email that you want to\n  redirect to a specific URL.\n\n* Set the target URL: This is the URL that the user will be redirected to when they click on one of the defined links.\n\n* Define the event properties: These are additional pieces of information that you want to send to Tracardi along with\n  the event. This could include information such as the type of event, the source of the event, or any other relevant\n  data that you want to track.\n\n* Set up the event tracking in Tracardi: This involves configuring Tracardi to receive and process the events that will\n  be sent from your Inbound Traffic/Event Redirects setup.\n\nOnce you have completed these steps, your Inbound Traffic/Event Redirects setup will be ready to use. When a user clicks\non one of your defined links, they will be redirected to the target URL and an event will be sent to Tracardi, providing\ninformation about the redirect and any event properties that you have defined."}

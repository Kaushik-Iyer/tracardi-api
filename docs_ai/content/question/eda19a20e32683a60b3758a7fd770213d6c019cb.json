{"file_name": "docs/upgrade.md", "questions": ["What steps are required to perform data migration between versions of Tracardi?"], "answer": "# Upgrades post version 0.7.2\nIn Tracardi version 0.7.2, a feature was introduced that allows for data migration between versions. Each new Tracardi installation creates a new, empty database, and the data from an old version can be migrated to the new one. To perform this migration, follow these steps:\n\n* Navigate to the maintenance/migration page.\n* Locate the migration script from the old version.\n* Follow the instructions provided in the script to complete the data migration.\n\nNote that this feature is only available in Tracardi version 0.7.2 and higher. If you are using an older version, you will need to upgrade to at least 0.7.2 in order to access this functionality.\n\n!!! Warning\n\n     If you perform multiple upgrades of Tracardi, the system will create a large number of new indices, which may cause you to reach the Elasticsearch\n     limit of 1000 indices. To resolve this issue, you can either increase the limit in the Elasticsearch configuration or delete the indices used by old\n     Tracardi versions. Tracardi version 0.8.0 includes a feature in the GUI to delete old indices. If you are using an older version, you can use the API\n     to delete old indices, such as issuing a HTTP DELETE call to /indices/version/0.7.2 to delete the 0.7.2 version indices. However, be cautious when \n     deleting old data, as there is no way to revert the system to an older version once the data has been deleted. It is important to thoroughly test your \n     new Tracardi installation before deleting any old data."}

This means that any change or error in workflow could break the running\nsystem. Therefore, workflows are in 2 different stages. One is production stage. This is the copy of a working workflow. \nThis workflow is running and the data is processed. It can not be changed. The second stage is development stage. This is a copy\nof a workflow that the user is editing. The change in this workflow is saved every 3 seconds. At some point it will become\na production workflow.\n\nChanging the state of the workflow as simple as clicking deploy button on workflow editor. Then current workflow is copied \nto production. The old production workflow is saved in case we need to revoke the deployed workflow for some reason."}

Invalid source.\"?"], "answer": "## Step 3: Refreshing the Page and Verifying the Response\nAfter refreshing your web page with the JavaScript code, you may notice a response from Tracardi indicating \"Access\ndenied. Invalid source.\" This is because the event source ID was not defined in the __tracker.source.id__ section of the\nsnippet.\n\n```\nHeaders:\nStatus: 401 Unauthorized\n\nBody:\n{\"detail\": \"Access denied. Invalid source.\"}\n```\n\nTo resolve this, create an event source in Tracardi and replace the string <your-resource-id-HERE> with the actual event source ID from Tracardi, as shown below:\n\n```html linenums=\"1\"\n<script>\n        !function(e){\"object\"==typeof exports&&\"undefined\"!=ty... // (3)\n        \n        const options = {\n            tracker: {\n                url: {\n                    script: 'http://192.168.1.103:8686/tracker', // (2)\n                    api: 'http://192.168.1.103:8686'\n                },\n                source: {\n                    id: \"ee2db027-46cf-4034-a759-79f1c930f80d\" // (1)\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n</script>\n```\n\n1. Correct `event source id`.\n2. Replace IP with the IP of Tracardi API. Please mind the port and correct it as well\n3. The code here is truncated for the purpose of more readable documentation.\n\nPlease notice that there is also the URL of Tracardi backend server. Please replace the IP e.g. `192.168.1.103` with the\naddress of your Tracardi server.\n"}

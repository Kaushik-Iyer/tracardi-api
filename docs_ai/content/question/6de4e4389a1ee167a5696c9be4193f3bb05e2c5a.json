Ideally, a session should remain the same during one visit, but should change when the user closes their\nbrowser or logs out.\n\n### Changing Session ID while Keeping Profile\n\nIn some cases, the client may want to keep the profile unchanged but change the session ID. To achieve this, the client\ncan provide the profile ID while generating a new session ID. This will result in a new session being created, while the\nprofile remains unchanged, and the system generates a new visit for the user.\n\n### Sending Same Session ID with Tracking Payloads\n\nWhile it is possible to send the same session ID with all the tracking payloads, allowing the system to keep the session\nand profile unchanged, this practice is not suggested. This is because if a profile is saved with only one visit, it\nwill not be possible to change the visits associated with the profile. It is recommended to generate a new session ID\nfor each visit to ensure accurate tracking and profiling of user behavior.\n\nIt is important to note that the session and profile management in Tracardi is crucial for accurate tracking and\nprofiling of user interactions. By understanding how sessions work and following recommended practices, clients can\neffectively utilize Tracardi's capabilities to analyze and understand user behavior on their website or application."}

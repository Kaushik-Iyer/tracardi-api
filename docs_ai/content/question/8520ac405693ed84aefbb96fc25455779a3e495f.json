Each worker is able to\nhandle asynchronous connections.\n\nEach instance of Tracardi API should be run on a separate server (physical or virtual). The point is that in the event\nof failure, the other instances could take over the tasks of the failed instance. There is no obstacle to run more than\nthree Tracardi instances.\n\n!!! Tip\n\n    We recommend installing Tracardi inside a k8s environment. Kubernetes automatically can bring back to life failed\n    docker instances."}

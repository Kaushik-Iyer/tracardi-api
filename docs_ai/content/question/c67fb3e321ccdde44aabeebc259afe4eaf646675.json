Warning \"Remember...\"\n\n    The following conditional statement is forbidden:\n    \n    ```\n    field1=1 AND field2=2 OR field3=3\n    ```\n\n    correct statement is either:\n    \n    ```\n    field1=1 AND (field2=2 OR field3=3)\n    ```\n    \n    or\n    \n    ```\n    (field1=1 AND field2=2) OR field3=3\n    ```\n    \n    There is no auto resolution of priority operations"}

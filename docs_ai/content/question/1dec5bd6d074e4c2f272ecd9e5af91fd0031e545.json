Available sources are:\n\n* profile\n* event\n* payload\n* flow\n* session\n* memory\n\nPath is a string of keys that indicate where the data is placed.\n\nFor example if your profile data looks like this\n\n```json\n{\n   \"key\": {\n        \"data\": \"value\"\n   }\n}\n```\n\nTo access \"value\" your path will need to look like this: *key.data*.\n\nThe full access dot notation is *profile@key.data*.\n\n!!! Warning\n\n    If there is an error in dot notation or it is not in a right format e.g `profile.data.name` instead of \n    `profile@data.name` then the result is the typed value, in this example `profile.data.name`. That means that any \n    value that is not a valid dot notation will be returned as is."}

{"file_name": "docs/integration/api/api-integration.md", "questions": ["What is the importance of including the profile ID in every call to the `/track` endpoint?"], "answer": "## Understanding the Profile\nThe profile is a critical part of the payload, and Tracardi aims to keep the profile unchanged at all times to ensure\naccurate tracking and profiling of customer behavior. Therefore, it is important for the client to save the profile ID\nand include it in every call to the `/track` endpoint.\n\nHowever, there may be cases where the profile is missing and needs to be created. This can happen in the following\nscenarios:\n\n* If the payload does not provide a profile ID, such as the first call to Tracardi when the customer's profile ID is\n  unknown and needs to be created\n* The profile ID is provided, but it does not exist in Tracardi's database.\n* If a profile ID is not provided in the tracker payload, but a valid previous session is provided, the system will\n  search for the lost profile by matching the last valid session and return the correct profile ID.\n\nIt is crucial to synchronize the profile ID returned in the response with the profile ID saved on the client side. If\nthe profile ID in the response is different from the one sent, it means that the client should update its profile ID and\ninclude the new one in the next call to avoid potential synchronization issues. Failing to do so may result in the\nprofile ID being recreated with each call to the `/track` API, which can lead to inaccurate tracking and profiling of\ncustomer behavior."}

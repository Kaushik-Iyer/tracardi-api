Workflow control when each action/node should be triggered. The action consists of an __input__, __a\nprogram__ that computes the input data, and __an output__ (the result of the program computation). In tracardi, an action can have\none input and many outputs. In addition, the action has a configuration, it is a set of data that define how the program\nshould behave, Let's assume that we want to connect to external resources of some database, it is in the configuration\nthat we will have information about where this database is, and what username and password to use to connect to the\nresource.\n\nDue to the fact that Tracardi can have many outputs, we must somehow indicate on which output our data should appear.\nThat's why Tracardi introduces concepts such as a port. Thanks to them, we can indicate where the data will be returned.\nThe port that will not receive the data (returns the None value) causes that the workflow will not be performed in this\nbranch of the workflow."}

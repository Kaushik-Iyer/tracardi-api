Tracardi microservices require you to set \nAPI_KEY environment variable. It must be at least 32 char long. And must be a random value hard to guess.\n\nPlease paste this value to API key input and click __get secret__. Your APIKEY will be replaced by token\nthat will allow you to access the server microservices."}

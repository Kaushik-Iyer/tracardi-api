{"file_name": "docs/development/micro_frontend.md", "questions": ["Q: What is the purpose of the `index.js` file in the `src` folder?", "Q: What is the purpose of the `package.js` file?", "Q: What is the purpose of the `App.js` file?", "Q: How is the configuration of the micro-frontend-app passed to the app?"], "answer": "## Source code\nNow, let's inspect the repo folders and find out what we have here:\n\nThere are two main folders:\n\n* __public__ - it holds the index.html file that you can use later for testing your micro-frontend-app\n* __src__ - this is where is your code. We will inspect this folder further below\n\nThe other files are `package.js` and `README.md` with installation tips. \n\n!!! Tip\n    \n    Please edit the app name in package.js. \n    `{\"name\": \"<name-widget>\", ...}`\n\n### Source folder\n\nInside `src` folder you will find a `index.js` file. This is where your app starts. Please change the \n\n```javascript\nconst widgetName = 'tracardi-uix-your-name'\n```\n\nto have the name of your app. \n\nThen there is `App.js`. This is the injected micro-frontend-app. Notice that it takes the domElement.\n\n```javascript title=\"App.js\"\nimport React from 'react';\nimport \"regenerator-runtime/runtime\";\n\nfunction App({domElement}) {  // (1)\n\n    const attribute = domElement.getAttribute(\"data-attribute1\") || \"I am test attribute\"\n    return <h1>\"Hello world \" + {attribute}</h1>\n\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n1. Dom parameter used to read the configuration of the micro-frontend-app. The configuration will be filled in Tracardi and passed as data attributes.  \n\nThis is because we need some way to pass the parameters to the app. And it is done by defining them inside the dom elements like this.\n\n```html title=\"This is the example form index.html\"\n\n<div class=\"tracardi-uix-your-name\" data-attribute1=\"my-attribute1\" data-attribute2=\"my-attribute1\"></div>\n<script src=\"widget/index.js\"></script>\n```\n\n!!! Tip\n\n    __Please notice__ that the class of the `div` must be the same as the application name defined in the `index.js` file. See below."}

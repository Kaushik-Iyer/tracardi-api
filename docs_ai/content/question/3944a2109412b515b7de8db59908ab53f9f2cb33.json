Actions may run one after another\nor in parallel. Workflow is represented as a graph of nodes and connections between them. Actions are assigned to nodes\nin the workflow graph. Actions may perform different tasks such as copying data from the event to profile, save profile,\nquery for additional data, send parts or whole data to another system or emit another event.\n\n![Browsing events](../images/workflow.png)\n\nWhen the workflow ends Tracardi checks if there is a need for profile update, segmentation, and merging."}

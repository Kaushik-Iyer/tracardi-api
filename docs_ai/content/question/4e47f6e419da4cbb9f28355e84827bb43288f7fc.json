Tip\n\n    When working with Tracardi the production server should not be edited directly. Instead, all changes should be made on the staging server and\n    thoroughly tested before being deployed to the production system. This helps to minimize the risk of errors or\n    disruptions in the live production environment.\n\n    Once changes have been tested on the staging server, they can then be deployed to the production system. This is done by\n    copying the data from the staging server to the production server. However, certain data such as events, profiles, or\n    error logs will not be copied over during this process to ensure that the production server data remains intact."}

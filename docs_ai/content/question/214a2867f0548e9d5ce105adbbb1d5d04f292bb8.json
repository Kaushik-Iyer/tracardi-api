For example:\n\n```javascript title=\"Example\" linenums=\"1\" hl_lines=\"5\"\nwindow.tracker.track(\n   \"page-view\",\n   {},\n   {\n    \"context\": {\"tag\": \"search\"}\n   });\n```\n\nIn the example above, a custom context object with a \"tag\" key and value \"search\" is added to the event options. This\nallows you to include additional information that is relevant to your specific use case."}

Then you can use the prebuilt docker and attach\nyour certificates. To do that pull `tracardi/tracardi-api-ssl`.\n\n```\ndocker pull tracardi/tracardi-api-ssl\n```\n\nThen copy your SSL certificates to any folder. For the purpose of this manual we place it in `/local/path/to/ssl`.\nYou can place it anywhere but remember to change the location in the command below:\n\n```\ndocker run \\\n-v /local/path/to/ssl:/ssl \\\n-p 8686:443 \\\n-e ELASTIC_HOST=http://<your-elastic-instance-ip>:9200 \\\n-e GUNICORN_CMD_ARGS=\"--keyfile=/ssl/key.pem --certfile=/ssl/cert.pem\" \\\ntracardi/tracardi-api-ssl\n```\n\nIt will start Tracardi with files from your local `/local/path/to/ssl` folder copied/linked to internal docker folder called `/ssl`.\nIf you placed certificates inside that folder then the files will be accessible form `/ssl` in docker.\nThe Docker image expects na SSL key file to be named `key.pem` and certificate to be named `cert.pem`."}

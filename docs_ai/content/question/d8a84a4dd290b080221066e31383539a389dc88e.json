We used onClick method to bind to click event. You might need\nto bind to other than click event. To do that use addEventListener:\n\n```javascript title=\"Example\" linenums=\"1\"\nconst btn0 = document.querySelector('#button')                 \nhelpers.addListener(btn0, 'mouseover', async ()=> {\n    // Code\n});\n```\n\nHelpers also have track method that let you send custom event to Tracardi at any time.\n\nThis is how you can use it:\n\n```javascript title=\"Example\" linenums=\"1\"\nconst response = await helpers.track(\"new-page-view\", {\"page\": \"hello\"});\n```"}

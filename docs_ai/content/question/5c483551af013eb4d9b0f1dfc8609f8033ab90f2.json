Return the whole profile object\n\nIf you would like to retrieve a sub-object form some bigger object. For example everything below __key__. (see below).\n\n```json\n{\n   \"key\": {\n        \"data\": \"value\"\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThen you need to use the following dot notation:\n\n```bash\nprofile@key #(1)\n```\n\n1. Return everything below __key__. The result will be ```{\"data\": \"value\"}```"}

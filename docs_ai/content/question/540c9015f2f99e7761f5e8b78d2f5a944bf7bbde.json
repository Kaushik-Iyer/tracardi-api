{"file_name": "docs/integration/js/response.md", "questions": ["What is the structure of event responses in Tracardi?"], "answer": "## Structure of Event Response\nEvent responses in Tracardi are structured in JSON format and contain various keys and values. The response typically\nincludes information related to different aspects of the workflow, such as saved events, errors, IDs, and types. For\nexample, in the provided example response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"response\": {\n    \"segments\": [\"a\", \"b\"]\n  },\n  \"ux\": {},\n  \"profile\": {\n    \"id\": \"0d2d9dc5-0d60-471e-956f-8766dcb8aba2\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe above response includes information about segments, profile ID, etc. \n\nTracardi provides you with the flexibility to configure response data within each event type workflow. This means that\nyou can define what data should be included in the response generated by a specific workflow, which is bound to a\ndefined event type and its properties. The response data can be structured and organized using response keys, such as\n`segments`, which are defined fields that contain the data returned by a workflow and can be copied from a profile, for\nexample.\n\nBy configuring response data in your event type workflows, you can specify the data that should be included in the\nresponse generated by that particular workflow. This allows you to return and data captured and processed in Tracardi\nbased on your specific requirements and business needs. You can define the response keys that should be included in the\nresponse, which can be used in downstream processes for further analysis, actions, and decision-making \n(e.g. content personalisation)."}

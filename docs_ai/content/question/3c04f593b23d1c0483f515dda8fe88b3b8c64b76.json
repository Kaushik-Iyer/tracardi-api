{"file_name": "docs/installation/upgrades.md", "questions": ["What is the update process for the system?", "How to update the system?", "What are the prerequisites for updating the system?"], "answer": "# System update\nAutomated system update is available from version 0.7.0. Previous versions were unable to update system data. There was\nonly an update of the code. As of version 0.7.0 the system keeps information about the indexes used. In addition, access\nto data is carried out using aliases, these are indicators for data, something reminiscent of symbolic links.\n\n## The update process\n\nWhen upgrading, Tracardi leaves the old version indexes unchanged and only marks them as the previous version (aliases\nto these indexes have the .prev suffix).\n\nAt the same time, new empty indexes are created along with new aliases. Then, if the schema of the old index has not\nchanged, the data pointer is switched from the old index to the new one. If the scheme has changed, the data is migrated\nusing a script that rewrites the data between indexes and copies the data from the old fields to the new ones,\nrespectively.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nHowever, it is important to only install dockers with a tagged version. The latest version may contain incorrect data,\nwhich may result in the loss of continuity of updates. As a result, it may be difficult to update the system."}

In the context of Tracardi, scaling may involve increasing the number of servers or instances (tracardi-api) in\norder to handle a larger volume of event tracking requests.\n\nTracardi is a stateless system, meaning that it does not rely on storing data locally in order to function. This makes\nit easier to scale, as new instances of Tracardi can be added or removed without affecting the overall functioning of\nthe system. We recommend using Kubernetes, a container orchestration platform, to manage the scaling and maintenance of\nthe Tracardi cluster. Tracardi does not require long-lasting sticky sessions, so it can be easily killed and re-launched\nwithout disrupting the cluster."}

It is the result of segmenting customer profiles. Segmentation is the process of dividing a customer base into smaller groups with similar characteristics. These segments can be described by a simple logical rule or by more complex AI models.\n\nIn the Tracardi system, a segment is a part of the customer profile, and it can be used in the segmentation workflow. A segment is typically represented by a simple sentence that describes the group, for example \"Customers with a high volume of purchases\". This group of customers, who have a high volume of purchases, can be targeted with specific marketing campaigns or other customer-centric actions based on their behavior and characteristics."}

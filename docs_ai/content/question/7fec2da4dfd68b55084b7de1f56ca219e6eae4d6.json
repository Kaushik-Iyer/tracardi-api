{"file_name": "docs/development/python_env.md", "questions": ["What is the command to run Tracardi API on port 8686 via uvicorn?", "What is the warning that may appear when connecting to elasticsearch without credentials set-up?", "What are the pros and cons of running API inside PyCharm?"], "answer": "## Running inside PyCharm\n1. Find folder `app` in `tracardi-api`\n2. Find file `main.py`\n3. Right click on it and select `Run 'main.py'`\n\nNow the Tracardi API is running. You should see the following logs:\n\n```text\nINFO:     Started server process [59653]\nINFO:uvicorn.error:Started server process [59653]\nINFO:     Waiting for application startup.\nINFO:uvicorn.error:Waiting for application startup.\nINFO:     Application startup complete.\nINFO:uvicorn.error:Application startup complete.\nINFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8686 (Press CTRL+C to quit)\nINFO:uvicorn.error:Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8686 (Press CTRL+C to quit)\n```\n\n!!! Bug \"Trouble shooting\"\n\n    If your logs stop on `INFO:uvicorn.error:Waiting for application startup.` that means your elasticsearch \n    docker is not running. Run it and the API will resule after the database is ready.  \n\n!!! Warning \"Running inside PyCharm\"\n\n    Running API inside PyCharm has some pros and cons. Pros are that you can debug the execution of API. Cons are that \n    when you change the code you have to rerun the program. \n    If you want to auto reload the API run in terminal \n    \n    ```bash\n    uvicorn app.main:application --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8686  #(1)\n    ```\n\n    1. Runs Tracardi API on port 8686 via uvicorn.\n\n    The above command will run serveral copies (workers) of Tracardi API.\n\n!!!

This is not an issue when \n    you run development version of Tracardi."}

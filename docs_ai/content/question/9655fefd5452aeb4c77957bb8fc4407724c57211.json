This can happen for various reasons such as using different devices, browsers or even different email addresses. In order to combine these data into one record, it is necessary to select a merging key that will be a unique value acress the whole system and by which the customer data could be combined. This can be an email address, credit card, or any other global identifier that can be used to group client profiles.\n\n!!! Example\n\n    For example, if a customer uses their laptop with Firefox browser, they may have one profile with an ID of 1. But when they use \n    the same device but using Google Chrome, they may have another profile with ID of 2. And when they use a mobile phone, they may \n    have a third profile with ID of 3. Even though they are the same person, they have 3 different profiles. Profile ID 1 may have \n    data about their purchases but not their name and surname, while their first and last name may be saved in profile ID 2. \n    Profile merging is needed to aggregate all the fragmented data set into one profile to have a complete understanding of the customer."}

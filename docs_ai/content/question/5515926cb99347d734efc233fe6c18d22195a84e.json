This setting defines an IP address of elastic search instance.\n  See `Connecting to elastic cluster` for more information how to connect to a cluster of servers.\n* `ELASTIC_SNIFF_ON_START` - Default: None. When you enable this option, the client will attempt to execute an\n  Elasticsearch sniff request during the client initialization or first usage. Search documentation for sniffing to get\n  more information.\n* `ELASTIC_SNIFF_ON_CONNECTION_FAIL` - Default: None. If you enable this option, the client will attempt to execute a\n  sniff request every time a node is faulty, which means a broken connection or a dead node.\n* `ELASTIC_SNIFFER_TIMEOUT` - Default: None, Time out for sniff operation.\n* `ELASTIC_HTTP_AUTH_USERNAME` - Default: None. Elastic search username. Search for elastic authentication for more\n  information on how to configure connection to elastic.\n* `ELASTIC_HTTP_AUTH_PASSWORD` - Default: None. Elastic search password. Search for elastic authentication for more\n  information on how to configure connection to elastic.\n* `ELASTIC_SCHEME` - Default: http. Available options http, https.\n* `ELASTIC_CA_FILE` - Default: None. Elastic CA file.

This may slow the elastic\n  significantly so be cautious with this setting.\n* `INSTANCE_PREFIX` - Default: None. It defines prefix for all elastic indexes. This can be used to run multiple\n  instances of Tracardi on one elastic instance.\n* `ELASTIC_LOGGING_LEVEL` - Default WARNING. Sets logging level of elastic requests.

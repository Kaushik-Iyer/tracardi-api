For example, the user references some data\nfrom the internal state of the workflow that he wants to an external API. To do this he uses so-called dot notation. \nDot notation is a way of specifying the location of the data. It looks like this. \n\n```\n<source>@<path.to.data>\n```\n\nThis is a working example:\n\n```\nevent@properties.email\n```\n\nIt means get the data from the event from its `properties.email`. A full description of all sources and how the data\nreference works can be found [here](../../notations/dot_notation.md).\n\nIn this tutorial we are interested in how to use this entry and retrieve data, and how to put a field in the form that\nwill require a dot notation entry."}

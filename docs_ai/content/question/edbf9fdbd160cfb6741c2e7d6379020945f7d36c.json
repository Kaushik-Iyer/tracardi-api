Note\n\n    The following instalation description use the latest tracardi container version. If you would like to install stable version \n    of the system, what we strongly recommend, please add to `tracard/tracardi-api` a tag with version, e.g `tracardi/tracardi-api:0.7.1`. \n    The same applies to `tracardi/tracardi-gui`. Keep the version of API and GUI the same. \n\n### Run Tracardi API\n\nNow pull and run Tracardi backend.\n\n```bash\ndocker run -p 8686:80 -e ELASTIC_HOST=http://<your-laptop-ip>:9200 -e REDIS_HOST=redis://<your-laptop-ip>:6379 tracardi/tracardi-api #(1)\n```\n\n1. Replace <your-laptop-ip> with your local laptop IP. You can remove `-e REDIS_HOST=redis://<your-laptop-ip>:6379` if\n   you did not start redis. Without redis some system features are unavailable.\n\nTracardi must connect to elasticsearch. To do that you have to set ELASTIC_HOST variable to reference your laptop's or\nserver IP.\n\n!!! Warning \"Waiting for application startup\"\n\n    Notice that when type `http://localhost:9200` you try to connect to Elastic on localhost. This means that you're\n    connecting to the docker itself as localhost means local in docker. Obviously elastic is not there, so Tracardi will\n    never connect. Pass external ip for elastic. This may be your laptop IP if you are running Tracardi locally.\n\nFor more troubleshooting solutions go to [Troubleshooting](../../trouble/index.md)\n\n\n### Connecting Tracardi to ElasticSearch via SSL\n\nIf you have an elasticsearch instance and you would like to connect to it via HTTPS this is the command you may find\nuseful.\n\n```bash\ndocker run -p 8686:80 -e ELASTIC_HOST=https://user:password@<your-laptop-ip>:9200 -e ELASTIC_VERIFY_CERTS=no -e REDIS_HOST=redis://<your-laptop-ip>:6379 tracardi/tracardi-api #(1)\n```\n\n1. If you want a certain version of docker image add version tag, e.g. `tracardi/tracardi-api:0.7.1`\n\n!!! Warning \"ELASTIC_VERIFY_CERTS set to No\"\n\n    Notice that the above command does not verify SSL certificates. If you would like certificates to be validated set \n    ELASTIC_VERIFY_CERTS to yes."}

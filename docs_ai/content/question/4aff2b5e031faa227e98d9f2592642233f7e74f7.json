These properties can provide valuable information about the event, such as the time it occurred, the location, the participants, and any relevant details or context. In the context of event reshaping, event properties may be separated out from the rest of the data in order to facilitate their analysis and interpretation. Event properties can be used to better understand the event, and can be useful in identifying trends, patterns, or relationships within the data."}

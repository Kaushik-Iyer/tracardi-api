As long as the session remains unchanged, the visit is considered to be ongoing. The session id is set when data is sent to Tracardi, and it is typically under the control of the client program.\n\nThe session often contains data about the context in which an event was launched, such as the type of device, operating system, or other characteristics of the user's environment. This data can be used to understand the context in which events are occurring, and to tailor the response or actions taken in response to those events.\n\nIn general, a session is a period of time during which a user is actively interacting with a system or application. Sessions are often used to track the actions and behavior of users over a period of time, and to provide personalized experiences or services based on that data.\n\n!!! Note\n    \n    One key characteristic of a session is that the data associated with it is usually temporary and volatile.\n    This means that the data is typically only stored for the duration of the session, and is not persisted beyond\n    that point. As a result, the data in a session is often considered to be ephemeral, and is not relied upon for \n    long-term storage or analysis."}

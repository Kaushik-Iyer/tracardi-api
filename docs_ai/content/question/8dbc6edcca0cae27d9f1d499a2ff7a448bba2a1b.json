By creating an event source,\ncreates a token that, when attached to the event data, will allow it to be sent through the above-mentioned endpoints\n\n!!! Tips\n\n    Event sources can be found in Tracardi GUI under Traffic. We have inbound traffic that comes to Tracardi - \n    we call it `event sources`. And there is outboud traffic sometimes called the destination. This is the external\n    system that the profile data can be sent when profile changes."}

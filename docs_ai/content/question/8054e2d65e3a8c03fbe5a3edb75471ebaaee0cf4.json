Programmers can use this library to develop Tracardi plugins. \n\n**The GUI** is a graphical interface that runs in the user's browser and allows end users to interact with the system.\n\n**The background workers** that perform background processes such as merging and segmentation.\n\nTracardi components can be installed and run separately, and multiple instances of each component can be activated to meet the needs of the business. For the system to work fully, at least four elements must be activated: \n\n- the database, \n- the API, \n- the GUI, and \n- the background import worker. \n\nThe GUI connects to the API, which in turn connects to the database.\n\nIn addition to the core components of Tracardi, the system may also include additional elements such as:\n* background processes for profile merging and segmentation, \n* data bridges for connecting to external systems, \n* microservices, and more.\n"}

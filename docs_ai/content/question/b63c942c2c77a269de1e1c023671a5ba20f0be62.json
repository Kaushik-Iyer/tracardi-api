These events allow you to track\nuser interactions that may occur after a user has navigated away from a page, providing valuable insights into user\nbehavior.\n\nTo configure a beacon event in Tracardi, you can add the asBeacon: true option to the track configuration. This\nindicates that the event should be sent as a beacon event.\n\n### Example of Beacon Event\n\nHere is an example of how to configure a beacon event in Tracardi:\n\n```javascript title=\"Example\" linenums=\"1\"\nwindow.tracker.track(\"page-view\", {}, {\"fire\": true, asBeacon: true});\n```\n\nIn the above example, the asBeacon option is set to true, indicating that the \"page-view\" event should be sent as a\nbeacon event, even if the customer leaves the page.\n\nBeacon events can be useful in scenarios where you want to track user interactions that may occur outside of the\nwebpage, such as form submissions, button clicks, or other events that may happen after the user has navigated away from\nthe page"}

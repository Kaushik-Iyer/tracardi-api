A profile can be used to summarize and organize data about a customer in a way that is easy to understand and access.\n\nA profile in the Tracardi system is a set of data that represents information about a customer. Profiles can be updated based on incoming events and data from external systems, and they can contain both public and private data.\n\nPrivate data in a profile is typically sensitive information, such as a user's name, email address, age, and total purchases. Public data in a profile may include information such as the segment to which a user belongs, the last time they visited a website, or the number of visits they have made.\n\nThe profile is updated by the workflow, specifically by the actions that are performed within the workflow. The data in a profile can be used for a variety of purposes, such as marketing campaigns and other types of analysis. By updating the profile based on incoming events and data from external systems, it is possible to maintain an up-to-date, comprehensive view of a customer."}

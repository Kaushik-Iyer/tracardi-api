UTM, which stands for\nUrchin Tracking Module, is parameter that is added to the end of a URL, allowing website owners to track various pieces\nof information about the source of the traffic, such as the campaign name, the medium used, and the source of the\ntraffic.\n\nTo store UTM information, Tracardi stores the first URL that contains the UTM code in a session. Subsequent clicks by\nthe customer will retrieve this information from the session, allowing Tracardi to continue tracking the customer's\nactivity and providing connection with campaign that brought the customer to the page.\n\nIn order to ensure that all UTMs are passed through to Tracardi, it is necessary to include them in the URL. This means\nthat any campaign-specific parameters should be included at the end of the URL, following a question mark (?), with each\nparameter separated by an ampersand (&). By doing so, Tracardi will be able to track the source and success of each\ncampaign, providing valuable data that can be used to optimize future marketing efforts."}

An operator is used to manipulate individual data items and\nreturn a result. Operators are represented by special characters or by keywords. List of operators is available below.\n\n``` title=\"Example\"\npayload@numberOfPurchases == 1\n```\n\nThis example will return __true__ if *numberOfPurchases* in payload equals 1. The data within our system is organized\ninto fields that are accessed using [dot notation](dot_notation.md). \n\n!!! Tip\n\n    Possible ways to access\n    data: ```payload@numberOfPurchases, payload@..., payload@numberOfPurchases.0, payload@numberOfPurchases[\"some key\"]```\n    For detailed instructions on how to access data using this notation, please refer to the \n    [dot notation](dot_notation.md) documentation.\n\nOperations can be joined by AND/OR.\n\n``` title=\"Example\"\npayload@numberOfPurchases == 1 AND payload@title == \"Title\"\n```\n\nThis example will return True if *numberOfPurchases* in payload equals 1 and *title* in payload equals \"Title\"."}

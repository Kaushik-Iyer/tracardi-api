This means that a single\n  profile can have multiple entities associated with it. For instance, you can have an entity called \"Purchase\"\n  associated with a specific user profile, and that user profile can have multiple purchase entities linked to it. This\n  allows for storing and managing collections of related data under a single profile.\n\n  On the other hand, the aux property in Tracardi has a one-to-one relationship. Each profile can have its own aux\n  property, which serves as an additional attribute associated with that specific profile. The aux property allows you\n  to store supplementary information related to the profile, but it is limited to a single set of data per profile.\n\n* __Usage__: Entities are commonly used when dealing with data that has a common theme or relationship but varies in\n  quantity. For example, entities can be utilized to store various actions, or interactions related to a customer, where\n  each entity represents a specific instance of that action (e.g. Purchase, Sent email).\n\n  Conversely, aux properties are typically employed to store specific details or metadata about a profile that are\n  unique to that individual. This can include preferences, additional user information, or any other supplementary data\n  that is directly associated with the profile itself.\n\nIn summary, the key distinction between entities and aux properties lies in their relationship and usage. Entities can\nestablish a one-to-many relationship between profiles and associated data, while aux properties maintain a one-to-one\nrelationship, providing an additional attribute specific to each profile. Understanding this difference allows for\nbetter organization and management of data within Tracardi based on your specific needs."}

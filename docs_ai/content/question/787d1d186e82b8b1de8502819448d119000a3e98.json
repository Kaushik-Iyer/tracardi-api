Both of these IDs need to be included in\nevery tracker payload when sending data to Tracardi. The session ID can be generated on the client side using a UUID4\nID, which is a unique identifier, to handle cases where the session is missing. On the other hand, the profile ID is\ngenerated by Tracardi's backend and is not available when a customer visits the page for the first time.\n\n### Obtaining the Profile ID\n\nTo obtain the profile ID, the recommended approach is to send the tracker payload without setting the profile ID, and\nonly generate the session ID. Tracardi will then return the generated profile ID, which needs to be saved on the client\nside. This is how the Tracardi JavaScript snippet works, by saving the profile ID in the browser's localStorage and the\nsession ID in cookies."}

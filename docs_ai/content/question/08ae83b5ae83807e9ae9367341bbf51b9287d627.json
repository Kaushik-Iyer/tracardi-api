{"file_name": "docs/qa/how_tracardi_uses_entities.md", "questions": ["What is an entity in Tracardi?"], "answer": "# What are entities and how can I use them.\nIn Tracardi, entity is concept used for storing and managing data. Tracardi maintains a separate index, which can be\nconsidered as a store or table, specifically designed to hold information about entities. Each entity has a unique type\nand associated data.\n\nThe entity index in Tracardi allows you to store various types of data, depending on your requirements. For example, you\ncan store information about email, products, or any other relevant data related to your business or application.\n\nTracardi provides plugins called \"Save Entity\" and \"Load Entity\" that enable you to interact with the entity index\nwithin your workflows. These plugins are available in the commercial version of Tracardi. With the \"Save Entity\" plugin,\nyou can save or update data for a specific entity in the entity index. The \"Load Entity\" plugin allows you to retrieve\nthe stored data of an entity from the index.\n\nEach entity is related to profile.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that if you are using the open-source version of Tracardi and require similar functionality, you\ncan utilize the \"profile@aux\" attribute to store data. While it may not provide the same dedicated entity index as in\nthe commercial version, the \"profile@aux\" attribute serves as a convenient way to store additional information within a\nuser's profile. You can leverage this attribute to store and retrieve data similar to how entities work in the\ncommercial version."}

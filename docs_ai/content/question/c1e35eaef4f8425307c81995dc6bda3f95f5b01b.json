This means that it does not contain sufficient information to identify a specific user or entity associated with the event.\n\nAn example of a profile-less event might be an event that describes an error in the system. In this case, the event would provide information about the error itself (such as the type of error, the location, and any relevant details), but it would not be tied to a specific user or profile. \n\nProfile-less events can still be useful for understanding the use journey, but they may not provide as much context or insight as events that are tied to specific profiles."}

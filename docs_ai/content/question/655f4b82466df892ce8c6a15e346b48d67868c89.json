Tracardi has a clear separation of a test and production data. This allows developers\nto test and refine new features or bug fixes in a safe and controlled environment, without impacting the performance or\nfunctionality of the live production website or application. It also allows QA Team to test the application before it\ngoes to the production. This helps ensure that the code is stable and functioning properly before it is made available\nto end users. Overall, using a staging server helps to minimize the risk of errors or disruptions in a live production\nenvironment, and helps to ensure the quality and stability of the final product."}

Save it somewhere safe as you won\u2019t be able to see it anymore once you leave\nthat screen. For example in a password manager. If you lose it, you will need to generate a new token.\n\nWe recommend you create a new token for every app or purpose. This way, you can easily delete or regenerate the token\nfor specific purposes and see which ones are still being used etc."}

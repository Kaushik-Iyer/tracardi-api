It happens when the type of data that is already in Tracardi is conflicting with\ndata that's being sent to be saved.\n\nFor example. Consider to following scenario. You have saved age as an integer number for example: 34, 25, 15, 67. It is\nsaved in properties.age. You 100 documents that are saved this way. You can easily search for anyone underage 21. But\nnow someone wants to send an age as a string e.g. \"21 years old\". This type of data is conflicting with existing data so\nTracardi will raise the error.\n\n```\nCould not save event.

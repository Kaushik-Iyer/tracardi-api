This class stores the internal state of the workflow, i.e. elements\nsuch as event data, profiles, etc. They can be useful for us while writing our plugin. Let's assume the simplest case,\nwe would like our workflow to react to the type of event that is sent to our system. It will check if the event is of\nthe type \"my-event\" and then it will return data from the input on the output named \"MyEvent\" otherwise it will return\nempty data on the port \"NotMyEvent\".\nOf-course we could use the built-in IF node, but we want to write our own."}

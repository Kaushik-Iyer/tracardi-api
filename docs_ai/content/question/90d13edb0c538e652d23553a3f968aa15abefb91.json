{"file_name": "docs/events/event_tracking.md", "questions": ["What is a webhook and how is it used?"], "answer": "## Tracking events with webhook\nA webhook is a way for an application to provide other applications with real-time information. It allows one application to send a message or information to another application when a specific event or trigger occurs. \n\nWebhooks are typically used to send data from one application to another over the internet. They can be used to connect a wide variety of applications and services, such as social media platforms, payment gateways, and customer relationship management systems.\n\n### Profile-less events and webhooks\n\nIn some cases, we may not have access to a customer's profile data but we do have an identifier that allows us to identify the customer. An example of this scenario might be when we have a discount coupon and we know which customer received the coupon on external systems, but we do not have access to that information at the time of the event (which only includes the voucher ID). In these situations, we can send profile data as a profile-less event. This means that the system will not have a profile ID or create a new profile.\n\nHowever, it is possible to retrieve customer data from external systems and attach the appropriate profile at the time of event processing. This enables us to track and analyze customer data even when profile information is not available at the time of the event."}

{"file_name": "docs/events/event_tracking.md", "questions": ["What is an event?"], "answer": "## Event example\nEvents consist of three main components:\n\n1. The event type: This is a label that identifies the type of event that has occurred. For example, an event type might be \"product purchase\" or \"login attempt\".\n\n2. Event properties: These are the characteristics or attributes of the event that describe the specifics of the event itself. For example, an event that represents a user clicking a button might have properties such as the type of button, the location of the button, and the time at which the event occurred.\n\n3. Context: This refers to data that provides additional context or background information about the event. This data may not be directly related to the event itself, but it can provide valuable insights into the circumstances surrounding the event. For example, if an event represents a customer making a purchase at a store, the event context might include information about the weather conditions at the time of the purchase."}

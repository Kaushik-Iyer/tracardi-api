It may be another copy of Tracardi or other service.\n\nThe solution to this is to remap the port Tracardi is running. If you run Tracardi API like this change the port mapping\nfrom `8686:80` to some other port `8888:80`.\n\nChange:\n\n```\ndocker run -p 8686:80 -e ELASTIC_HOST=http://<your-laptop-ip>:9200 tracardi/tracardi-api\n```\n\nTo:\n\n```\ndocker run -p 8888:80 -e ELASTIC_HOST=http://<your-laptop-ip>:9200 tracardi/tracardi-api\n```\n\nRemember that when you change API port then you have it included in GUI as GUI uses API to access data.\n\nSo tak a look at lunch command for GUI:\n\nSo change default docker run command for Tracardi GUI\n\n```\ndocker run -p 8787:80 -e API_URL=//127.0.0.1:8686 tracardi/tracardi-gui\n```\n\nTo (notice: API_URL=//127.0.0.1:8888, this the where the Tracardi API is running)\n\n```\ndocker run -p 8787:80 -e API_URL=//127.0.0.1:8888 tracardi/tracardi-gui\n```"}

That means with a __script__ tag and a div\ncontainer. It appends the needed tags at the bottom of the page. Like this.\n\n```html title=\"This is the example form index.html\"\n\n<div class=\"tracardi-uix-your-name\" data-attribute=\"my-attribute\"></div>\n<script src=\"widget/index.js\"></script>\n```"}

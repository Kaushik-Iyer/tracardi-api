The first way requires a commercial bridge, while\nthe second way is an open source method. The open source method involves passing your profile ID in properties, copying\nit to profile IDs in a workflow, and storing it in the profile's \"ids\" property. This allows you to use your own ID to\nget the profile. It's important to note that if you expose the collector to the internet, you must ensure that your\nprofile ID is in the form of a UUID4 or another hard-to-guess ID to avoid messing up data.\n"}

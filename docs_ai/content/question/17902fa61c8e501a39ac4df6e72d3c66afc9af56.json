To\nenable this feature, static ID must be enabled in the event source that collects data, and the profile ID must be added\nto the script configuration.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```html title=\"Example\" linenums=\"1\" hl_lines=\"15-17\"\n\n<script>\n\n        !function(e){\"object\"==typeof exports&&\"undefine...  \n\n        const options = {\n            tracker: {\n                url: {\n                    script: 'http://192.168.1.103:8686/tracker', \n                    api: 'http://192.168.1.103:8686'\n                },\n                source: {\n                    id: \"<your-event-source-id-HERE>\" \n                },\n                profile: {\n                    id: \"<your-static-profile-id-HERE>\" \n                }\n            }\n        }\n</script>\n```\n\nIt's important to note that this will send the provided profile ID regardless of whether a profile ID is already stored\nin the browser's local storage. If event source si not configured to allow static profile ID then System will try\nto load profile with provided ID - it will most probably fail and then it will generate the random ID. Please do\nnot use this feature with events sources that has disabled static profile processing in events source. \n\n!!! Warning\n\n    Please be aware that sending a profile ID that's easy to guess can be a security risk. Attackers can potentially guess\n    the ID and try to corrupt its data. Always use IDs like UUID4 to ensure security.\n\n!!! Notice\n\n    This feature is available from version 0.8.1 up."}

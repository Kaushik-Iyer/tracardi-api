The error is not directly related to CORS, but is a fundamental network error of some kind.\n\nIn many cases, it is caused by a browser plugin (e.g. an ad blocker or privacy protector) blocking the request.\n\nOther possible causes include:\n\n* Trying to access an https resource that has an invalid certificate will cause this error.\n* Trying to access an http resource from a page with an https origin will also cause this error.\n* As of Firefox 68, https pages are not permitted to access http://localhost, although this may be changed by Bug\n  1488740.\n* The server did not respond to the actual request (even if it responded to the Preflight request). One scenario might\n  be an HTTP service being developed that panicked without returning any data."}

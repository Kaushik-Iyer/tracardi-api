It also includes the IP address of the user.\n\n!!! Tip\n\n    When working with Tracardi, you have the option to configure whether or not to include page data in the context of \n    each event. This configuration is done at the tracker level and can be customized according to your requirements. \n    By adjusting the tracker context configuration, you can easily control whether or not page data is sent along with \n    each event, providing you with flexibility and control over the data captured and processed."}

{"file_name": "docs/events/index.md", "questions": ["What are event traits?"], "answer": "## Event traits\nEvent traits are characteristics of an event that are indexed in the system for the purpose of analysis and aggregation. Traits differ from event properties in that they are structured in a way that allows them to be searched, analyzed, and aggregated more effectively.\n\nTo index event data, the data is moved from the properties of the event to traits. For example, if an event includes a property that describes the type of device that was used to initiate the event, that property could be converted to a trait so that all events involving the same device type could be identified and aggregated.\n\nEvent traits can provide valuable insights into the behavior and patterns of users or other entities within a system. By analyzing events with traits, it is possible to identify trends, correlations, and other relationships that may not be immediately apparent from the raw event data."}

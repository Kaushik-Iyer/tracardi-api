GUI\ncluster should be accessible only from trusted network for security reasons. Although the cluster with Tracardi API may\nbe set up as one cluster we recommend running 2 clusters with slightly reconfigured instances.\n\nOne cluster, the one available on the Internet, consisting of at least 3 instances should be configured with\nenvironment variable `EXPOSE_GUI_API` set to `no`. This way the publicly available API will have only `/track` endpoint available.\nThis cluster will be used for event collection from the website on the Internet. All other endpoints that are needed for\nthe GUI will be disabled.\n\nAnother cluster, the one available in the internal network, or available on the Internet but restricted to certain set\nof IPs, should have the environment variable `EXPOSE_GUI_API` set to `yes`. This cluster will be used by GUI to control Tracardi."}

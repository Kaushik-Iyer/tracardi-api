Inclusive ranges are specified with square brackets \n[min TO max] and exclusive ranges with curly brackets {min TO max}. By default, when you filter by query ranges in \nfiltering box (right to the filter textbox) are disabled. You can define ranges as query.\n\n\n### Examples\n\n* All days in 2012:\n  ```\n  date:[2012-01-01 TO 2012-12-31]\n  ```\n  \n* Numbers 1..5\n\n  ```  \n  count:[1 TO 5]\n  ```\n\n* Tags between alpha and omega, excluding alpha and omega:\n\n  ```\n  tag:{alpha TO omega}\n  ```\n  \n* Numbers from 10 upwards\n\n  ```\n  count:[10 TO *]\n  ```\n\n* Dates before 2012\n\n  ```\n  date:{* TO 2012-01-01}\n  ```\n\n* Ranges with one side unbounded can use the following syntax:\n\n  ```\n  age:>10\n  age:>=10\n  age:<10\n  age:<=10\n  ```"}

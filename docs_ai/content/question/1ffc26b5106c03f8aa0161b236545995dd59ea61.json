The installations described in\nthe previous sections are mainly used for testing purposes. A production installation should be built with at least five\nTracardi API instances, two instances of GUI, and three elasticsearch instances.\n\nSetting up an elastic search cluster is beyond Tracardi configuration and can be handled by ready to use cloud instances\nthat expose one IP but hide 3 and more instances of the database."}

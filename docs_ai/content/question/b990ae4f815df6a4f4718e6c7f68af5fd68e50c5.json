Only tracardi-api is required to run the API. Tracardi library will be installed as dependency.\n    2. Installs dependencies of Tracardi API.\n\n=== \"Windows\"\n\n    ```bash\n    cd tracardi-api\n    venv\\\\Scripts\\\\activate\n    \n    // Installs dependencies\n    pip install -r app\\\\requirements.txt\n    deactivate\n\n    cd ..\n\n    cd tracardi\n    venv\\\\Scripts\\\\activate\n    \n    // Installs dependencies\n    pip install -r tracardi\\\\requirements.txt\n    deactivate\n\n    ```\n\n=== \"Mac OS\"\n\n    ```bash\n    # Activates virtual environment (1)\n    cd tracardi-api\n    source venv/bin/activate\n    \n    # Installs dependencies\n    pip install -r app/requirements.txt\n    deactivate \n\n    cd ..\n    \n    cd tracardi\n    source venv/bin/activate\n    \n    # Installs dependencies (2)\n    pip install -r tracardi/requirements.txt\n    deactivate\n    ```\n\n    1. Only tracardi-api is required to run the API. Tracardi library will be installed as dependency.\n    2. Installs dependencies of Tracardi API.\n\n!!! Tip\n\n    Before creating the virtual environment make sure you have version 3.9.x installed. Type `python --version` to \n    see the python version.\n\n!!! Bug \"Trouble shooting\"\n\n    If you see an error that some of the libraries can not be installed, this may mean that you do not have python \n    version 3.9.x installed in your virtual environment."}

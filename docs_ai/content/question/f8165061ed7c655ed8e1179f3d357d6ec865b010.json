All other terms are optional. \n\nFor example, this query:\n\n```\nquick brown +fox -news\n```\n\nstates that:\n\n* fox must be present\n* news must not be present\n* quick and brown are optional their presence increases the relevance\n\n### And, or, not\n\nThe boolean operators AND, OR and NOT (also written &&, || and !) are also supported but beware that they do not honor\nthe usual precedence rules, so parentheses should be used whenever multiple operators are used together. For instance \nthe previous query could be rewritten as:\n\n```\n((quick AND fox) OR (brown AND fox) OR fox) AND NOT news\n```"}

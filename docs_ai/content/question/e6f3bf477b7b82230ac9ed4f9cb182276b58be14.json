One way to do this is to\nencode the traffic as it is sent to the load balancer, but leave the internal cluster traffic decoded. This allows for\nsecure communication with the API while still allowing for efficient communication within the cluster. If you prefer to\nhave encoded traffic throughout the entire cluster, you will need to prepare HTTPS versions of the Tracardi Docker\nimages. This will ensure that all traffic, both external and internal, is encrypted for added security. It is important\nto carefully consider the security measures in place when working with sensitive data, and setting up an encrypted\nconnection to the Tracardi API is an important step in protecting this information. See\nthe [documentation on how to do it](../configuration/tracardi_ssl.md)."}

It is done by following rules and procedures.\n\nThe process begins by downloading the current customer profile from the database. If the event is configured to be processed by a workflow that has the profile merging action defined, or if the event is defined as an identification point in the customer journey, the system will use the defined \"merge key\" to load the profile data again necessary using this key instead of profile's ID. The merge key is usually an email address, credit card, etc.\n\nIf the system finds more than one profile with for example the same email address, it will merge the data from all profile records. The current profile and all other profiles that contain the merge key will be combined into a single profile.\n\nIf there are different values for the same field, for example, if one profile has the name \"Bill\" and another has the name \"William\", the system will consider the data to be in a \"conflict state\". The system will pick the last value and override the name, but will also save all available values in an \"aux.conflict.name\" field, for this example that would be [\"Bill\", \"William\"].\n\nThe combined profile will be given a new ID, and a new profile record will be created. All obsolete profiles will be deleted, and the events that were associated with the deleted profiles will be copied to the new merged profile.\n\nThe new profile ID will be saved by the javascript code on the device's local database. However, it's important to note that this does not mean that the reference to the current profile has been changed on all devices. It means that the system has a master profile of the customer with all the data collected from different devices but the devices themselves may not be updated with the new ID."}

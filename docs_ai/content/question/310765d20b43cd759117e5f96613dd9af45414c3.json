{"file_name": "docs/getting_started/core_definitions.md", "questions": ["What is an event in Tracardi?", "What types of events can be tracked in Tracardi?", "How are events triggered in Tracardi?"], "answer": "## Event\nIn the Tracardi, events are representations of something that is happening at a particular time. **Events can be used to track visitor behavior** on a website or application, and they can capture a wide range of actions and interactions. Examples of events may include clicks on links, logins, form submissions, page views, or any other action that needs to be tracked, such as a purchase order. Events can pass additional data, such as a username, a purchased item, or a viewed page, depending on the type of event and the data that is being tracked.\n\nWeb site events in Tracardi are typically triggered when JavaScript is executed on a selected page, or when an API query is made to the `/track` endpoint. Since the tracking code is present on every page, it can emit events as users interact with the site. The events and their types are configurable, and it is possible to configure the data that is sent for each event.\n\nEvents can be stored inside Tracardi, or they can be passed to a workflow to be processed outside the system. This allows for a wide range of flexibility in terms of how events are tracked and used within the Tracardi system.\n\n!!! Note \n\n    Tracardi has 2 types of event. Event with profile and without profile. Read about event \n    in [Event's Core Definitions](../events/index.md)"}

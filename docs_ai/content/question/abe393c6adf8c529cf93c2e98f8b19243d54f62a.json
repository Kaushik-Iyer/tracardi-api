This setting is used only when `SYNC_PROFILE_TRACKS` is equal to yes.\n  This is the host URI of Redis instance that is required to synchronize profile tracks. Available only in commercial\n  version of Tracardi.\n* `SOURCE_CACHE_TTL` - Default: 60. Each resource read is cached for given seconds. That means that when you change any\n  resource data, e.g. credentials it wil be available with max 60 seconds.\n* `CACHE_PROFILE` - Default: no. Profiles can be cached, but it is not recommended as this option is experimental."}

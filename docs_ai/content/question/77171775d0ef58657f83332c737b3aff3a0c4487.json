In the provided example, the event response is captured using the\nwindow.onTracardiReady event and accessed through the context.response object. For example:\n\n```javascript title=\"Example\" \n // Change page if has response custom.text\n window.onTracardiReady.bind( ({tracker, helpers, context, config}) => {\n     if(context?.response?.custom?.text) {\n         const customText = document.getElementById('custom')\n         customText.innerText = context?.response?.custom?.text\n     }\n })\n```\n\nIn the above example, the context.response.custom.text value is accessed from the response and used to update the\ncontent of an HTML element with the id attribute of 'custom'. This allows you to dynamically change the page content\nbased on the data returned from Tracardi workflows."}

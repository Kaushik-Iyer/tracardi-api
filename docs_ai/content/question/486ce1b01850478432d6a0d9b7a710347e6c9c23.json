An action consists of input and output ports, which are used to receive and send data, respectively. The input ports of an action are used to receive data from other actions or from external sources, while the output ports are used to send data to other actions or external systems.\n\nAn action is essentially a piece of code that performs a specific task within the Tracardi system. The input ports of an action are mapped to the input parameters of a function in the code, while the output ports are mapped to the return values of the function. This allows actions to be chained together in a workflow, with the output of one action being passed as the input to the next.\n\nTracardi can be extended by programmers who write custom code and map it to an action, which is then visible as a node in the workflow editor. An action may also be referred to as a node or an action plugin within Tracardi.\n\nFor more information about actions, see the [More on actions](../flow/actions/index.md) documentation."}

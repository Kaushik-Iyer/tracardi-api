A segment can be defined using a simple logical rule or by more complex artificial intelligence (AI) models.\n\nOnce a segment has been defined, it becomes a part of the customer's profile. A segment defined in the Tracardi system can be used in the segmentation workflow, which allows for targeted marketing and other types of personalized experiences or services.\n\nA segment is typically represented by a simple key, such as \"high-volume-customers,\" and is described by a brief summary or description, such as \"Customers with a high volume of purchases.\" This allows for easy identification and understanding of the characteristics or behavior that define a particular segment."}

When the app is finished, you will have to bundle it and open\non the `index.html` in your browser and see if it loads.\n\n### Testing bundled app file\n\nFirst you will have to build the app with `yarn build:widget`. It will create\na __index.js__ file in __widget folder__. \n\nTo test if your app works as micro-app paste the bundled file `widget/index.js` into a regular HTML page. \n\n!!! Tip \n\n    You do not have to create index.html by your self. We have one created for you in the repo in the\n    public directory. It is called `index.html`. Paste the __script__ tag together with the configuration inside \n    the __body__ of the `index.html` and open the file. \n\n```html title=\"This is an example public/index.html from one of our micro-apps\"\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>\n    \n    <!-- (1) -->\n    <div class=\"tracardi-uix-cta-message\"\n         data-title=\"title\"\n         data-message=\"message\"\n         data-cta=\"visit\" data-cancel=\"\"\n         data-auto-hide=\"50000\"\n    ></div>\n    \n    <!-- (2) -->\n    <script src=\"../widget/index.js\"></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n1. The app container with the configuration in data attributes. __Please notice__ that the class of the `div` must be\n   the same as the application name defined in the `index.js` file.\n2. The bundled app script\n\nNow open the __index.html__ in the browser, and it should load your app and display it on top of the existing\nindex.html. If the index.html does not have any html then it will be empty as in our example."}

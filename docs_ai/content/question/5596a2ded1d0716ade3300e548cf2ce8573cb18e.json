Therefore, the system does not\nknow what indexes were used previously and it is not able to check the changes that have occurred in their schemas. That\nmeans, the manual data migration by re-indexing is necessary. If the collected data in previous versions is not\nimportant and it is possible to lose it, we recommend a fresh install."}

For example, a user must visit our website at least 10 times.\n\nFor example:\n\nSegment named: `Frequent visitor`. He has a criterion that looks like this:\n\n``\nprofile@stats.visits > 10\n``\n\n#### Result of segmentation\n\nIf the profile in its statistical data has been saved that the number is more than 10, then the segmentation id will be\nadded in the profile in the segments item, which will look like `frequent-visitor`.\n\nA profile can belong to multiple segments."}

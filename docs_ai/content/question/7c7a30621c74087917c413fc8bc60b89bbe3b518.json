Both devices have references to the customer's profile, but the profile ID is different on each device. On the laptop, the profile ID is 1, and on the mobile phone, the profile ID is 2.\n\nAt some point, the customer enters their email address into the online store using their laptop. A new merged profile is created and it has an ID of 3. The reference to this profile is saved in the browser on the laptop. However, the reference to the old profile is still stored on the mobile phone.\n\nNext time when the customer uses their mobile phone to access the online store again, the system will use the old profile ID to identify the customer. But, instead of loading old profile, the system will download the new merged profile. This happens because Tracardi has the capability to recognize that an old profile ID no longer exists and has been merged with the new profile. Device will receive new profile ID that will be saved locally. \n\nThis way, the information about the linked profile will be propagated to all devices. The customer will have the same profile ID on both devices and all the data will be updated and merged, this way the system can have a complete customer view and provide a better customer experience."}

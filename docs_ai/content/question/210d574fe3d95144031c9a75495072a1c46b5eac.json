A destination requires a specific resource, such as an API endpoint or a queue service, in order to receive and process the data.\n\nNot all resources are available as destinations in the Tracardi system. For more information about outbound traffic and the available destinations, see the [outbound traffic](../traffic/outbound/index.md) documentation.\n\nIn general, a destination is a place or system to which data is sent or forwarded for further processing or storage. It can be used to transfer data from one system or application to another, allowing for the integration and exchange of information between different platforms or services."}

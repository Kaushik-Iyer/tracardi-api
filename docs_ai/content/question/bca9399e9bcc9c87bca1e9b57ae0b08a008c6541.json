  "answer": "## Sending event on demand\nTracardi offers the flexibility to send events immediately when the fire parameter is set to true, enabling real-time\nevent triggering and ensuring that data is captured and processed instantly. By default, events are queued and sent when\nthe web page is fully rendered, which is beneficial for consolidating events and sending them as a single request.\nHowever, there are scenarios where sending events immediately upon certain actions, such as button clicks, is necessary.\nSending Events in Real-Time\n\nTo send events in real-time, simply set the `fire` parameter to `true` when making API requests or using the Tracardi\nJavaScript snippet on your web page. This will bypass the event queue and send the events without any delay.\n\nThis feature is particularly useful in scenarios where real-time data processing is critical, such as tracking user\ninteractions, capturing user behavior, and implementing dynamic marketing strategies. \n\n### Example: Breaking the Event Queue\n\nIn some cases, you may need to break the event queue and trigger an event immediately upon a certain event type. \nYou can do this by setting the fire parameter to true in your JavaScript code, as shown in the example\nbelow:\n\n```javascript title=\"Example where we break the event queue\" linenums=\"1\"\nwindow.tracker.track(\"purchase-order\", {\"product\": \"Sun glasses - Badoo\", \"price\": 13.45})\nwindow.tracker.track(\"interest\", {\"Eletronics\": [\"Mobile phones\", \"Accessories\"]}, {\"fire\": true}) //(1)\nwindow.tracker.track(\"page-view\",{});\n```"

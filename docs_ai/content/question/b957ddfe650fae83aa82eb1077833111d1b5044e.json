However, it is possible to include a session ID in the\nredirect link when sending a message from Tracardi. To do this, use the following format for the extended link:\n\n```\nhttp://<tracardi-api-url>/redirect/<redirect-id>/<session-id>\n```\n\nWhen using this extended link, Tracardi will associate the click with the profile that corresponds to the specified\nsession ID.\n\nTo obtain the session ID, use session@id. If you wish to send the redirect link via email, you can use the provided\ntemplate and access the session ID using {{session@id}}.\n"}

Tracardi stores the consent for direct contact and, depending\non the consent granted, you can, for example, send the customer a confirmation of the transaction by e-mail or, only\ndisplay it on the website.\n\nTracardi can increase customer engagement by asking questions about transaction satisfaction. For this\npurpose, Tracardi uses micro applications (micro frontends) that can be conditionally attached to a regular website,\ndepending on what has been defined in the workflow editor. These types of applications appear as pop-ups on the website\nand can send subsequent events to the system with customer answers.\n\nTracardi also integrates other contact methods, such as sending SMS notifications, e-mails or contact via external\nsystems."}
